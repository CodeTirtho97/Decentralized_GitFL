# Decentralized_GitFL
Decentralized GitFL enables privacy-preserving collaborative AI training by removing the central server bottleneck found in traditional federated learning systems. By applying Git's version control principles to a fully distributed architecture, devices can exchange model updates directly, manage model staleness effectively, and optimize communication patterns through reinforcement learning. Our experiments show 5% accuracy improvement and 7.2Ã— faster convergence compared to centralized approaches, making the system ideal for resource-constrained IoT environments where privacy and resilience are critical.
